# Master Duel Things

A collection of scripts I use for managing the Art and IDs from Master Duel.

Thanks very much to @ioncodes for dumping the cards in his [repo](https://github.com/ioncodes/master-duel)!

The `mapped_cards.json` contains all the cards with their Konami ID. (Most of the `Not Found` cards are Tokens)

## Run exs script

```sh
elixir <script>.exs
```
